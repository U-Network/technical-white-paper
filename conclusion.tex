\chapter{Conclusion}

We have introduced \emph{U network}, which is a revolutionary content-value based prediction market platform and a content-incentive community powered by blockchain technology. In this platform the valuable contents are encouraged to be created and discovered by all participants with the rewards of monetized tokens.  

The long-term goal of \emph{U Network} is to build a decentralized user-generated-content community, where high-quality contents can be created, discovered and promoted to more audience in an efficient approach. To motivate all participants, regular users needs to pay \emph{U Network} token as cost in order to access high-quality contents, while other contributors will receive \emph{U Network} tokens as an incentive. Both content creator and explorer can be rewarded for their different contributions. As such, the platform brings plenty of value to all participants. 

In particular, \emph{U} Community will be the first digital asset platform powered by \emph{U network} blockchain technology. \emph{U Network} team believes that more decentralized user-generated-content applications will be deployed on the \emph{U Network} public blockchain in the near future. \emph{U Network} will bring revolutionary changes to each different industry.
